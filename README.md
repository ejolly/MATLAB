## Supporting Matlab code

*If you're looking for my academic research projects, they're likely located in the [Dartmouth CosanLab Repository](https://github.com/cosanlab)*  

Maybe one day I'll turn this into a proper toolbox. Right now it's just random helper functions that I've made or "borrowed" from places like Matlab Central.

These are often loaded as git-submodules for other repositories.
